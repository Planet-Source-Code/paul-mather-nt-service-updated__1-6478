## NT Service \(Updated\!\)


</div>

### Description

Here's an update to my post on NT service. I've found the API examples is MSDN to be incorrect. I've tried to fix some of these bugs and make the routines useful. However, the best addition is a Microsoft OCX to make services easy! NTSVC.OCX is included and free to distribute. Take a look at the sample code an decide for yourself. NTSVC finally makes running your app as an NT service easy!!!<BR><BR>
